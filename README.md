# Temperature PCB 

This project is a custom-designed PCB board dedicated to reading temperature data from sensors and transmitting it over a CAN bus to the main board of our solar-powered boat. It is being developed as part of the SolarBoat Team initiative.

## 📌 Project Description

The PCB allows for the connection of temperature sensors and handles:

- Reading temperature data from two sensors
- Transmitting the data via the CAN bus to the central control board


## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

- Designed for compatibility with CAN communication
- Carefully selected components to ensure:
  - Accurate temperature measurement
  - Stable data transmission
  - Low power consumption

## 🔧 Use Case

This PCB will be one of several boards connected to the main controller via a CAN bus. It plays a crucial role in monitoring environmental conditions inside the solar boat, contributing to system diagnostics and safety.

## 🛠️ Team

This project is developed by me to the SolarBoat Team, a student engineering group focused on building innovative and sustainable watercraft.
